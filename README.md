# Lab-Kurs-1 Project - Hospital Management System

This is a school group project for "Lab Course 1". 

The Hospital Management System provides a comprehensive platform for all hospital staff to save and manage data related to patients, staff, and inventory. With the Hospital Management System, hospital staff can manage appointments, patient records, medical histories, billing information and other records, all from one centralized location.

The Project includes two folders:

Hospital Management System folder - contains the backend of the website, built using ASP .NET CORE 6

projekti_lab folder - contains the frontend of the website, built using React.js

To run the project, you need to run both the front end and the back end, so they can communicate with each other.
